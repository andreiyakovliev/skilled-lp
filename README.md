# Skilled e-learning landing page

My challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## Technologies:

HTML, CSS (SCSS), GULP.

Responsive design
